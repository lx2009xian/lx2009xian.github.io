excerpt: "This presentation explores the phenomenon of ‘rejuvenated’ academic articles—papers that regain citation vitality long after publication—using a new field-database-dependent relative citation approach."
---
In this contribution, we use a **field-database-dependent relative citation** approach to analyze the **citation performance** of scholarly articles during two distinct citation life phases:  
the **initial period** and the **second citation life**.  

We focus particularly on papers that exhibit an **unexpected revival of attention** years after their initial publication, which we describe as *rejuvenated articles*.  

Our findings indicate that certain papers experience a **second wave of recognition**, where their **relative citation impact** during the later stage surpasses that of the early period.  
This suggests that these works are not merely cases of delayed recognition (*sleeping beauties*), but rather demonstrate an actual **rejuvenation effect** in scholarly influence.

### Key Points
- Introduced a novel **relative citation metric** sensitive to field and database context.  
- Identified a subset of articles exhibiting **renewed citation growth** after an early decline.  
- Discussed implications for **bibliometric modeling** and the understanding of **knowledge diffusion over time**.
