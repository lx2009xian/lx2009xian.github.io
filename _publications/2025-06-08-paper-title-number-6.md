This paper introduces a novel framework based on **ego citation networks** to systematically measure the diffusion and influence of transformative research beyond academia.  
By constructing ego-centered citation structures, the study identifies how fundamental discoveries influence **technological innovation** and **policy documents** through both direct and indirect citation pathways.

### Key Contributions
- Proposes an **ego citation network** method to assess research influence propagation.  
- Quantifies both **direct** (academic-to-patent, academic-to-policy) and **indirect** impacts of transformative research.  
- Provides empirical validation using large-scale bibliometric and policy datasets.
