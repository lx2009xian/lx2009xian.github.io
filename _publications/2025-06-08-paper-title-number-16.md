We conduct a systematic analysis of scientific publications in the emerging research frontier of **exoplanets**.  
Our primary methodology is **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**, which we employ to identify latent research themes and their diachronic evolution.

### Key Findings
- **Top themes and trends** in exoplanet research were identified through topic modeling.  
- **Leading journals** and **collaboration structures** were visualized using co-occurrence networks of country-country and institution-institution collaboration.  
- The **scientific frontiers** of exoplanet studies were delineated, and the themes with the highest citation impact were recognized.  
- The **average number of co-authors per paper** has steadily increased, indicating growing collaboration in the field.  
- Despite its growth, **few exoplanet studies are cited by patents**, and **few patents originate from this domain**, showing limited industrial translation so far.
