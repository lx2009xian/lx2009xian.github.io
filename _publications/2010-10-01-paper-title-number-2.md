This paper explores the concept of **author visibility** in the context of multi-author scientific publications.  
We propose using Nonlinear Visibility Determination with a Modified Sigmoid Function (NVDMS) to identify the most visible authors and investigate their individual (byline order, academic age, gender), organizational (occupations), and national (affiliated country) characteristics across different years and team sizes. 

### Key Contributions
- A method to measure scholars’ visibility in collaborative teams is presented. 
- Characteristics of the most visible scholars are determined.
- These characteristics include byline order, academic age, gender, occupations and affiliated country.
- This is done diachronously and according to team size.
