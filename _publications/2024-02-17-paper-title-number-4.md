This paper examines the **interdisciplinarity of references** in Nobel Prize–winning research to test the assumption that highly innovative studies are necessarily interdisciplinary.  
By analyzing bibliometric data across Nobel-winning publications, the authors find that **many groundbreaking works actually draw from narrow disciplinary reference bases**, suggesting that disruptive innovation may sometimes emerge from deep specialization rather than broad interdisciplinarity.

### Key Contributions
- Challenges the assumption that high-impact research is always highly interdisciplinary.  
- Uses large-scale **bibliometric analysis** to measure reference interdisciplinarity in Nobel Prize papers.  
- Reveals distinct **disciplinary citation patterns** associated with different Nobel fields.
