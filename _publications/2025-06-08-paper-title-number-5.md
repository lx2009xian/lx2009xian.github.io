This study explores the role of **gatekeepers** in bridging the gap between **scientific research and technological applications**.  
Focusing on the field of **gene editing**, it identifies individuals and institutions that serve as key intermediaries in the flow of knowledge between basic science and applied technology.

### Key Contributions
- Introduces a conceptual framework for identifying **knowledge transfer gatekeepers**.  
- Applies **citation and co-authorship network analysis** to map linkages between science and technology domains.
