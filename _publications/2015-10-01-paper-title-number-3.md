This study introduces a **quantitative approach** for evaluating privacy leakage risk in user-generated textual content on social media platforms.  
By leveraging **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques and **information entropy modeling**, the authors developed a probabilistic framework to assess how sensitive information might be inferred or exposed through linguistic patterns.

### Key Contributions
- Proposes a **privacy leakage probability model** for social network text.  
- Integrates **semantic embeddings** and **entropy-based uncertainty metrics** to quantify privacy exposure.  
- Demonstrates empirical results using large-scale datasets from social platforms.
