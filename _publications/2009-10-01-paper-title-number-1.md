This paper introduces the concept of **innovation lineage structure**, a graph representation describing how individual scholars’ publications evolve in thematic and citation relationships. By integrating bibliometric data and network topology analysis, we examine how lineage patterns are associated with **research disruptiveness**—the degree to which new ideas displace prior paradigms.

### Key Contributions
- Identified the innovation lineage structure, a graph structure in publications, utilizing a large-scale scholarly dataset.
- Examined the factor associated with the disruption of scientific output from a macro perspective on the innovation lineage structure.
- Found that publications within the innovation lineage structure have higher disruption compared to those outside.
- Demonstrated that exploration research strategies drive the higher disruption of publications within the innovation lineage structure.
