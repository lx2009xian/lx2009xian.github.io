**Non-patent references (NPRs)** play an important role in the interaction between **science** and **technology**.  
In this contribution, we compare the characteristics of **NPRs traced from patents on “metabolic engineering”** to those of the **top 10% most-cited articles** (cited in scientific publications but excluding NPRs) in the same field.

We observe that:
- There is a **low rate of co-citing articles** between the two groups.  
- Many **NPRs exhibit higher citation performance** than the top 10% scientific articles.  

These results provide **preliminary evidence** that NPRs possess unique properties distinguishing them from highly cited academic works.  
They offer valuable insights into the **interface between science and technology**, revealing how knowledge flows from research to innovation.

### Key Findings
- Comparison between **NPRs and top-cited scientific papers** in metabolic engineering.  
- Identification of **distinct citation behaviors** and **impact asymmetries**.  
- Discovery of NPRs with **superior citation performance** compared to traditional scholarly articles.

Non-patent references · NPRs · Metabolic engineering · Knowledge transfer · Science-technology interface · Bibliometrics
