Wildfires alter dissolved organic matter (DOM) in ecosystems, producing **pyrogenic dissolved organic matter (pyDOM)** that can act as precursors to harmful **disinfection byproducts (DBPs)** during water treatment.  
This study explores how **chlorination** transforms pyDOM from various plant and soil sources and identifies the molecular features driving its cytotoxic effects.

Using **high-resolution mass spectrometry** and **reactomics**, the study reveals that increasing pyrolysis temperature reduces H/C ratios but elevates O/C ratios, aromaticity indices (AImod), and nominal oxidation states of carbon (NOSC).  
Cytotoxicity assays identified **lignin-, condensed aromatic (ConAC)-, and tannin-derived** compounds as the main toxicity contributors.

### Key Findings
- **PyDOM molecular transformation:** Elevated pyrolysis temperature enhances oxidation and aromaticity.  
- **Cytotoxicity mechanisms:** Chlorination induces toxicity through **chlorine substitution**, **hydroxylation**, and **addition reactions**.  
- **Indicator traits:** Four molecular traits (mass, AImod, O/C, and H/C) serve as predictive toxicity indicators.  
- **Environmental implication:** Soil-derived pyDOM poses stronger risks to cell viability, while plant-derived pyDOM triggers oxidative stress responses.
