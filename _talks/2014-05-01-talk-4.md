This study investigates whether **scientific research is becoming more application-oriented**, focusing on the **emerging topic of metabolic engineering** within biomedical fields.

To test **Tijssen’s hypothesis** regarding Application-Oriented Fields (AoFs), we operationalize AoFs as the **Web of Science Subject Categories** included in the 25 AoFs identified by Tijssen. A **time-series analysis** was conducted on the cumulative yearly AoFs rates for both publications and citations from **2001 to 2018**.

Our findings show a **consistent upward trend** in the AoFs rates for both papers and citations, suggesting that research in **metabolic engineering** has become **increasingly application-driven** over time. This reflects the growing translational nature of research linking **basic biochemical processes** with **biotechnological innovation**.

### Key Points
- Introduced an operational definition for **Application-Oriented Fields (AoFs)** based on WoS categorization.  
- Conducted a longitudinal analysis (2001–2018) on AoFs publication and citation rates.  
- Found that both research output and impact in metabolic engineering are **shifting toward application-oriented domains**.
