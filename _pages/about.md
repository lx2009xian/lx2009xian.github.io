# 👋 Introduction

Hi, I'm **Xian Li (李贤)**, currently a **Research Assistant (tenure)** at **Chongqing University, Chongqing General Hospital**, and a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow (tenure-track)** at **Southwest University**, Chongqing, China.

I received my **Ph.D. in Social Medicine and Health Service Management** from **Zhejiang University** in 2024, and my **B.A. in Information Management and Information Systems** from **Zhengzhou University** in 2018.  

My research interests lie broadly in **computational social science**, **scientometrics**, **innovation networks**, and **graph-based representation learning**.  
I’m particularly interested in understanding how information, innovation, and collaboration propagate through complex social and knowledge systems.

You are welcome to reach out if you’d like to collaborate on **data-driven studies in social and health sciences**.
